## Install ##

# run this to update ~/.bashrc

## Overview ##

`task-git.sh` is a wrapper around Taskwarrior's `task` that places the task
database in version control, and generates commits each time the `task` database
is altered.

## Usage

1. Navigate to your Taskwarrior data directory (usually in `~/.task`) and type `git init`. If you plan to push to a remote, go ahead and add your remote now.
2. Add `alias task=/path/to/task-git/task-git.sh` to your `.bashrc` or
`.profile`. If you want to push to a remote, then the alias should be `alias task=/path/to/task-git/task-git.sh --task-git-push`. Make sure you source the `.bashrc` or `.profile`.
3. Run `chmod +x /path/to/task-git/task-git.sh`.
4. Use `task` as normal; when run, the Taskwarrior database files will be committed to version control.

It is recommended to use the Taskwarrior database only on one machine, as you will be resolving conflicts if using the same task database on multiple machines.
